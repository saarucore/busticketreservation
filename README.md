# busticketreservation

This is a bus ticket booking project that aims to simplify the process of booking bus tickets for customers. The company has implemented a Database Management System (DBMS) using Django, HTML, and JavaScript for the front end and SQL for the database. The project has been designed to provide an efficient and user-friendly interface for customers to book their bus tickets and for the company to manage its operations effectively.

The system allows customers to search for available buses based on their preferred route, date, and time of travel. Customers can select the type of bus and seat they want to book, and they can pay for their tickets using various payment methods, including credit cards, debit cards, and mobile wallets. The system also allows customers to cancel their tickets and receive refunds based on the company's cancellation policy.

The system provides the company with a comprehensive dashboard that allows them to manage their fleet, track their revenue, and analyze their operations' performance. The company can also manage their staff, including drivers and conductors, and monitor their performance using the system. The system generates reports that provide insights into the company's operations, revenue, and performance.

The project has been developed using Django, a high-level Python web framework, HTML, and JavaScript for the front end, and SQL for the database. Django provides a robust and secure framework for developing web applications, while HTML and JavaScript provide an interactive and user-friendly interface. The use of SQL for the database ensures that the system can handle large amounts of data efficiently.
